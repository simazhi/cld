```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(CLD)
library(tmcn)
library(tidyverse)
```

Goal: to extend the current CLD with traditional characters, just for easier access in the future.

The measures all still only hold for simplified characters.

```{r}
cld %>%
  mutate(WordTrad = toTrad(Word, rev = FALSE)) %>%
  rename(WordSimp = Word,
         S1 = C1,
         S2 = C2,
         S3 = C3,
         S4 = C4) %>%
  mutate(T1 = toTrad(S1, rev = FALSE),
         T2 = toTrad(S2, rev = FALSE),
         T3 = toTrad(S3, rev = FALSE),
         T4 = toTrad(S4, rev = FALSE)) %>%
  select(matches("Word|[ST][1234]"), everything()) -> cld_extended
```



```{r}
save(cld_extended, file = "cld_extended.rda")
```

```{r}
rm(cld_extended)
```

```{r}
load("cld_extended.rda")
cld_extended
```

The extended CLD is now saved.
