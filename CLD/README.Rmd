# CLD â€” the Chinese Lexical Database

<!-- badges: start -->

This is a wrapper around the .rda file provided at http://www.chineselexicaldatabase.com/index.php

The Chinese Lexical Database, developed by Sun et al. (2018) is a large-scale database for Mandarin Chinese, in simplified characters.
The paper can be found here:

Sun, C. C., Hendrix, P., Ma, J.Q. & Baayen, R. H. (2018). Chinese Lexical Database (CLD): A large-scale lexical database for simplified Mandarin Chinese. Behavior Research Methods, https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-018-1038-3.

The CLD package contains the whole CLD version 2.1, with a few editions:

* `Word` has been recoded as `WordSimp`
* `C1, C2, C3, C4` have been recoded as `S1, S2, S3, S4`
* `WordTrad` contains the traditional variants of `WordSimp`
* Conversely, `T1, T2, T3, T4` are the traditional versions of `S1, S2, S3, S4`

This has been done in order to facilitate the usage in traditional texts. 
Note, however, that the psycholinguistic findings of the CLD all still relate to traditional characters.

The CLD package can be installed as follows:

## Installation

```r
devtools::install_github("simazhi/cld/CLD", 
                         auth_token = AUTH_TOKEN) # need token as long as it's private
```
